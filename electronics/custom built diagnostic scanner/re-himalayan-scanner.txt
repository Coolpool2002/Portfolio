This project involved building a diagnostic interface for a 2021 Royal Enfield Himalayan using the Euro 4 (6-pin) diagnostic port.

    Designed and prototyped a circuit using 2 × 4N35 optocouplers for safe K-Line communication

    Interfaced the bike’s K-Line (ISO 9141) with an Arduino Uno using custom-built hardware

    Implemented basic KWP2000 protocol functions to read and clear fault codes, including persistent ABS faults

    Added serial output for monitoring responses and diagnostic feedback in real time

    Housed the circuit in a custom 3D-printed case designed to fit under the bike seat

    Successfully cleared fault codes without relying on dealership tools or OBD adapters

This project demonstrated practical skills in serial communication, automotive protocols, opto-isolation, and hardware prototyping.
