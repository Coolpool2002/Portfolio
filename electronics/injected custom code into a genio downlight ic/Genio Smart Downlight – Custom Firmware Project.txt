In this project, I reverse-engineered a Genio Wi-Fi smart downlight to regain local control without relying on cloud services.

    Disassembled the light and identified the onboard WB3S module (Tuya-based Wi-Fi chip)

    Soldered to the serial TX/RX/GND pads to access the chip via UART

    Used BKWriter tool to flash custom firmware (e.g. OpenBeken or Tasmota)

    Enabled local control over Wi-Fi without using the Genio app or Tuya cloud

    Verified functionality by toggling brightness and power from a local web interface

This project showcased practical skills in soldering, serial communication, and embedded firmware replacement.
