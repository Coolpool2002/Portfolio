# Hayden's Project Portfolio

This is a collection of personal projects I’ve worked on over time — covering electronics, motorbike restoration, 3D printing, and coding.

I’ve grouped things by category so it’s easy to navigate. Most folders have photos, notes, or code depending on the project.

## 🛠 Motorbike Projects
- Work on a Royal Enfield Himalayan: replaced the swingarm, rebuilt the rear brake, and made a custom intake bell using a 3D printer.
- Built an Arduino-based diagnostic tool that plugs into the Euro 4 port — can read/clear codes and stream live engine data.

## 🔌 Electronics
- Reverse engineered a Genio smart downlight using an ESP8266.
- Breadboarded small circuits and tested microcontroller setups with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

## 🖨 3D Printing
- Designed and printed a modular gear ratio demo system.
- Made functional parts like an intake bell, a DVD tray stash box, and Xbox controller thumbstick extensions.

## 💻 Programming
- **Flappy Ball 1 & 2**: simple games made in Python and JavaScript, with login and score tracking features.
- Other mini projects like a number guessing game.
